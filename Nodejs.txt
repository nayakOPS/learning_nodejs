--Intro to NodeJs--

V8 engine + C++ = Node.js

Now,Js can talk to native machine because of c++ , can create web server in JS too
File handling can be done by JS

So, Nodejs is a runtime environment for JS

Long Term Support(LTS) / Stable release can be used for production 
versioning style : Even version (LTS)
.and for odd version it is of new version not suitable for production

npm(Node Package Manager) by default automatically shipped to Node,  when installing Node.js

To run Node.js program -- node program_name or node program_name.js

npm init - makes template for the project , for running our project
            --after initialiizing npm package.json is made where it is a configuration File
        Making our own script for running the program
        
        "scripts": {
            "run" : "n0de hello.js"
        }

        when npm run is entered automatically the node hello.js is runned

[NOTE:- When node_modules folder is deleted the package.json have info of all dependencies 
        install so installing npm in the dedicated directory will install the dependencies and make the node_modules folder]

--About Modules--

For Modular programming the code base should be devided into small code  called Modules
so the code will be split into different file for seperation of concern of modules/program

Look modules folder for program representation

require() function has all the builtin package likfe http,fs from node directory
require("fs") --> Search for fs module/package in node module directory
require("./fs") --> Search for fs module/package in the current directory

--About Filehandling--
Look the Filehandling folder for understanding about file handling

--About NodeJs Architecture--
Look the NodejsArchitecture folder for understanding about NodejsArchitecture

--About HTTP Server--
Look the HTTPserver folder for understanding about HTTPserver and look ORL folder too for info about URL and query parameters working

--About HTTP Methods--
Look the HTTPmethods folder for understanding about HTTP Methods 

--About Express Framework--
Look the Express folder for understanding about express Framework

--Look how the versioning works in versioning.txt file--

--Look at restfullAPI and restAPIserver Folder--
For understanding about routes , api, and many more

--Look at Middleware folder and restAPIserver Folder--
For understanding about how middleware works and its fucntioning in restAPIserver folder
