How Versioning works in NodeJS

"dependencies": {
    //version look like this
    "express": "^4.19.2",
    "nodemon": "^3.1.0"
  }

Version has three parts like : ^4.19.2
1st part -> 4
    Major Release / Breaking Update
    //Your Code may run or not, due to Breaking Update

2nd part -> 19
    Recommended Bug Fix / Security Fix / New Feature Added

3rd part -> 2
    Minor Fixes, Optional Update -- mainly like typos

Now, the Carrot Symbol ^
        -- it is requiring the major version to be remain same , i.e: ^4 install the 4 version
        When updating it can range from | 4.18.2 | < | 5.0.0 | , it can be eithr 18.3,19.5,19.0 etc

Now, the tilde symbol ~
        -- Not changing the first and second part version also , only the minor(3rd part) version can be updated
