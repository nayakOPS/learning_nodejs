Client Makes request to a Server

Event Loop Watches over the Event Queue for which event to run based on (FIFO) principle.

The Event or Request can be Blocking Operations(Sync) or Non-Blocking Operation(Async),
Event loop checks after whether the event is blocking operation or Non-blocking opeartion 
If it is non-blocking operation then it is normally done by picking it from event Queue
or If it is  blocking operation, then the event is gone to thread pool , the thread process our event/Operation to do

Thread Pool Size depends upon CPU
the default Thread Pool size is 4
Max size = depends upon the server CPU core 
-8 core Cpu - 8 threads available
